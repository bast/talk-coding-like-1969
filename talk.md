## CodeRefinery: what is our impact?

## CodeRefinery: lessons learned

### Demand

- .emph[Demand for training] is huge.
- [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) offer great courses in basics but there is .emph[need for more advanced courses].

### Collaborative version control

- Around a third of workshop participants are new to .emph[version control].
- Very few participants use .emph[code review] and .emph[automated testing] before arriving at our workshop.

### FAIR

- .emph[Software licensing and copyright] aspects are new to most participants.
- Code publishing and .emph[code citation principles] are new to most participants.
- .emph[FAIR principles] in software management are far from standard.

## Software reproducibility 10-year challenge:

# Try to build **your code** from 10 years ago

---

## Software reproducibility 10-year challenge

### Couple of uncomfortable questions:

- Can you still .emph[find] your code?
- It was probably not on GitHub (GitHub launched only 11 years ago, GitLab is only 6 years old).
- Can you bring it to a .emph[well-defined state]?
- Can you find corresponding documentation?
- How about .emph[external dependencies]? Have you locked their versions?
- Have you used Git submodules? Have they moved?
- Any hard-coded paths?
- If you manage to build it, how do you know it produces the same results as in the past?

---

## Have you ever seen these sentences?

.quote["software used in this study is available upon request"]

- What does this mean in terms of findability and accessibility?

.quote["we have used a locally modified version of code X"]

- What does this mean in terms of findability, accessibility, and reproducibility?

## Great project: Software Heritage

### https://www.softwareheritage.org

### [@swheritage](https://twitter.com/swheritage)

Building the universal software archive.

Collects, preserves, and shares software source code for present and future
generations.

.emph[Initiated by Inria], the French national research institute for the digital sciences.

---

## Publishing computational results without accompanying code will become unacceptable

.quote["With some exceptions, anything else than the release of source programs is intolerable for results that depend on computation"]
.cite[Ince, D. C., Hatton, L. & Graham-Cumming, J., Nature 482, 485 (2012)]

.quote["Programs should be published in source language (rather than binary)"]
.cite[Roberts, K. V., Comput. Phys. Comm. 1, 1 (1969)]

.quote["The scientific community should always be able to verify that a published program will produce correct results"]
.cite[Roberts, K. V., Comput. Phys. Comm. 1, 1 (1969)]

## Sharing papers

<img src="img/sharing-papers.jpg" style="width: 80%;"/>

- We want maximum visibility and maximum reuse.
- The more interesting science is done referencing my paper, the better for me.

---

## Sharing code

.quote["I did all the ground work and they get to do the interesting science?"]

- Sharing code and encouraging derivative work may boost your academic impact.

---

## Code review should become a standard practice

.quote["A program should be carefully checked by colleagues [...] before it is submitted for publication [...] and it should be refereed"]
.cite[Roberts, K. V., Comput. Phys. Comm. 1, 1 (1969)]

---

## Code review

<img src="img/code-review.jpg" style="width: 80%;"/>

.cite["A FAIRer future" Nat. Phys. 15, 728–730 (2019), https://doi.org/10.1038/s41567-019-0624-3]

- Review and discuss changes .emph[before they are merged]
- Good idea if junior student reviews code of senior colleague
- .emph[Great learning opportunity]
- Consider code reading sessions in your group

---

## Social coding

<img src="img/in-out.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/>

.cite[Idea: R. Darst, adapted]

- Whether you can share your output depends on how you obtained your input.
- .emph[Software licenses matter].
- Sometimes "OTHERS" are you yourself in the future.

## Code is on GitHub with a standard open source license

# Is this enough?

---

## Public access alone may not be enough

- Putting your code on GitHub/GitLab does not guarantee that the software is findable and accessible in the future.
- How about the persistence of the service and repository and versions?
- The average lifetime of a web address has been estimated to be 44 days. .cite[Kahle, B. Preserving the Internet. Scientific American (July 27, 1998)]
- Assigning a .emph[digital object identifier] (DOI) to the version referenced in a published manuscript .emph[is a must].

### Great services to get a DOI:

- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org)
- [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io)
- [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org)
- [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org)
- [Figshare](https://figshare.com)

## Programming languages

---

## "Which programming language do you recommend?"

- A programming language perfect for everything does not exist.
- Each language has its .emph[own strengths].
- .emph[Often we do not have the choice] since we enter an existing project.
- If you choose an exotic programming language, you may get fewer .emph[collaborators].

### Personal opinions

- .emph[Python] has a rich ecosystem and very active community.
- Prefer Python over Matlab since Python is free.
- Rust and Julia are very interesting emerging languages.
- Object-oriented programming is often not the answer: it introduces
  an implicit time-dependence into your functions.

---

## Write programs for people

.quote["Write each program, quite deliberately, for other people to read and understand"]
.cite[Roberts, K. V., Comput. Phys. Comm. 1, 1 (1969)]

.quote["Many programs remain in use much longer than their authors originally expect"]
.cite[Roberts, K. V., Comput. Phys. Comm. 1, 1 (1969)]

## Challenges

## We more or less have the tools, **what are we missing**?

---

## Establishing a culture and the need for training

- We need to support a .emph[culture of sharing].
- Encourage, credit, and eventually expect openness.
- Challenge for students and researchers, principal investigators, editors, referees,
  funding bodies, and hiring committees.
- .emph[Training is critical].

---

## Credit

.quote["it is important to attract the right people, and one of their main incentives will be the credit"]
.cite[Roberts, K. V., Comput. Phys. Comm. 1, 1 (1969)]

- Make it possible to show their work on their CV.
- Help creating an ecosystem where such CVs count.
- Create and support .emph[career paths].

## Conclusions/recommendations

### Link to these slides: http://bit.ly/strasbourg50

  **tell your university leaders about Carpentries and CodeRefinery**.
- .emph[Encourage sharing] and open source.
- Use .emph[code review] in your group.
- Consider FAIR principles from the start.
- Spending a month on learning version control, editor, scripting, 1-2 programming
  languages really well is not a waste of time.
- Connect with other research software engineers.
- Attract developers with .emph[career opportunities].
- .emph[Influence hiring committees] to not only look at the number of papers - we get what we measure.
