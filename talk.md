slide 1 about the coderefinery project

In the CodeRefinery project [1] we teach tools and practices for the
development of reproducible and reusable research software. In the first two
years of the project we have trained over 550 students and researchers across
all academic disciplines. Our goal is to advance FAIRness [2] of software
management and development practices so that research groups can
collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share, and reuse their codes.
Our lessons include basic and collaborative Git, Git branch design, code
documentation, automated testing, Jupyter notebooks, integrated development
environments, CMake, social coding and open software, modular code development,
and reproducible research.

## Goals for this talk

- Lessons learned from teaching 20 workshops on research software engineering

### Challenges for the next two decades

- FAIRness in research software development
- Peer review and code review
- Software engineering and academic credit
- Training needs

Publishing computational results without accompanying code will become unacceptable

## Software reproducibility 10-year challenge:

# Try to build **your code** from 10 years ago

## Software reproducibility 10-year challenge

### Couple of uncomfortable questions:

- Can you still .emph[find] your code?
- It was probably not on GitHub (GitHub launched only 11 years ago, GitLab is only 6 years old).
- Can you bring it to a .emph[well-defined state]?
- Can you bring its documentation to refer to the same state?
- How about .emph[external dependencies]? Have you locked their versions?
- Have you used Git submodules? Have they moved?
- Any hard-coded paths?
- If you manage to build it, how do you know it produces the same results as in the past?

Public access today may not be enough to make software findable and accessible in the future

---

Code review should become a standard practice

---

FAIR

---

Dependencies and package management

---

Sharing code and encouraging derivative work may boost your academic impact

---

respect version control

---

version control without code review

---

how code review works

why code review

- learning

---

forking

- licenses
- open master
