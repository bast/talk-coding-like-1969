slide 1 about the coderefinery project

In the CodeRefinery project [1] we teach tools and practices for the
development of reproducible and reusable research software. In the first two
years of the project we have trained over 550 students and researchers across
all academic disciplines. Our goal is to advance FAIRness [2] of software
management and development practices so that research groups can
collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share, and reuse their codes.
Our lessons include basic and collaborative Git, Git branch design, code
documentation, automated testing, Jupyter notebooks, integrated development
environments, CMake, social coding and open software, modular code development,
and reproducible research.

the paper

---

In this talk we will discuss lessons learned from teaching 20 workshops on
research software engineering. Particular focus will be put on the importance
of collaborative code development frameworks and code review (peer review
during code development). We will discuss training needs necessary to give
researchers the tools and knowledge to develop software which will stand the
test of the next two decades: managing code complexity with software which is
modular, reusable, reproducible, and extensible.

Publishing computational results without accompanying code will become unacceptable

---

10-year challenge

---

Public access today may not be enough to make software findable and accessible in the future

---

Code review should become a standard practice

---

FAIR

---

Dependencies and package management

---

Sharing code and encouraging derivative work may boost your academic impact

---

respect version control

---

version control without code review

---

how code review works

---

why code review

- learning

---

forking

- licenses
- open master
